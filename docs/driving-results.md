## Question: How do you approach understanding business problems and customer journeys when working on a project?

**Answer:** My approach to understanding business problems and customer journeys involves close collaboration with Snapâ€™s Platform Integrity and Customer Operations team. I initiate in-depth discussions with key stakeholders to gather comprehensive insights into the business challenges and user experiences. By conducting user interviews, analyzing data, and leveraging customer feedback, I aim to develop a holistic understanding of the issues at hand. This process ensures that my solutions are not only technically sound but also aligned with the overarching business goals and user needs.

## Question: Can you describe your process for designing and building scalable applications/features focused on creating business impact through self-service features?

**Answer:** My process for designing and building scalable applications involves a systematic and iterative approach. I begin by translating business requirements into detailed technical specifications, considering factors like scalability, performance, and user experience. Using tools such as Vue.js, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, I create wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface. Throughout the development cycle, I prioritize regular feedback loops with stakeholders to ensure that the features align with business impact goals. This iterative feedback loop, combined with agile development methodologies, results in user-friendly, scalable, and impactful features.

## Question: How do you ensure high application uptime for Zendesk help center services?

**Answer:** Ensuring high application uptime for Zendesk help center services requires a proactive and multi-faceted approach. I implement best practices for reliability, scalability, and performance optimization. Thorough testing, both automated and manual, is conducted to identify and address potential bottlenecks in the codebase. Working closely with other Snap engineering teams, I address performance issues promptly, leveraging my knowledge of AWS/GCP to optimize the underlying infrastructure. Additionally, I collaborate with the Zendesk administration team to stay abreast of platform updates and best practices, ensuring the ongoing stability and uptime of the help center services.

## Question: Describe your approach to collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver on time-tested and reusable code in a fast-paced environment.

**Answer:** Effective collaboration with cross-functional teams is foundational to successful project delivery in a fast-paced environment. I establish clear and open communication channels with Snap engineering teams, Zendesk administration, and IT partners. Agile methodologies, such as regular sprint planning and stand-up meetings, are instrumental in maintaining a fast-paced development cycle. To ensure code quality and reusability, I emphasize the importance of comprehensive codebase documentation and prioritize the creation of modular and well-documented code. This approach streamlines collaboration, accelerates development cycles, and contributes to the production of reliable and reusable code.

## Question: How do you handle compatibility and cross-browser issues while maintaining the technical needs of highly used integrations?

**Answer:** Managing compatibility and cross-browser issues is a critical aspect of delivering a seamless user experience. I adopt a comprehensive testing strategy, conducting thorough tests across various browsers and devices to identify and address compatibility challenges early in the development process. Continuous integration practices, coupled with automated testing tools, are instrumental in proactively catching and resolving issues. Regular updates and patches to the codebase, informed by user feedback and real-world usage, contribute to ongoing improvements in compatibility and overall user experience.

## Question: Can you share an example of a project where you demonstrated results-oriented problem diagnosis and creative problem-solving skills?

**Answer:** In a previous role, I encountered a performance issue in a customer-facing feature. To address this, I conducted a comprehensive analysis, employing various profiling tools and monitoring mechanisms to identify bottlenecks in the code. I then implemented targeted performance improvements, optimizing critical sections of the codebase. The result was not only the resolution of the performance issues but also a significant increase in user satisfaction and engagement. This project showcased my results-oriented problem diagnosis skills and demonstrated how creative problem-solving can lead to impactful outcomes.
